About
=============
The project is a watchface for the Andorid wear platform and uses the 'Canvas Watchface Service' API recently released by Google.

How to use
=============
The project is production ready and can alternatively also be used as a tutorial to learn about the new API.

For developers, please check the TextWatchFace.java service in the /wear directory for implementation.

Design & tests
=============
The design of the watchface has been inspired from the Fuzzy clock display as seen on pebble watches.

Bug fixes and improvements will follow.

The app has been tested and works fine on the Moto 360. Please let the developer know if there are issues on any other watchfaces.
